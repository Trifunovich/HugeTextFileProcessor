Don't forget to update  paths inside config file

For benchmarks, there is a configuration, run it with -benchmark configuration to start benchmarking
Paths inside benchmarks are hard coded, so they need to be updated inside code, also active benchmarking class

There are two ps1 scripts for creating benchmark data out of a formatted file, format of a file is [number]. [some string] in each row

In configuration there are values that can be adjusted based on your system capabilities. Tweaking might increase performance or lower memory consumption. 

The project is created to be more memory efficiant than performant.
